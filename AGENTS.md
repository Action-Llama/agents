# Action Llama Project

This is an Action Llama project. It runs automated development agents triggered by cron schedules or webhooks.

## Project Structure

Each agent is a directory containing:

- `agent-config.toml` — credentials, model, schedule, webhooks, params
- `PLAYBOOK.md` — the system prompt (playbook) that defines what the agent does
- `Dockerfile` (optional) — custom Docker image extending the base `al-agent:latest` (e.g. to install extra tools like `gh`)

## Creating an Agent

1. Create a directory for your agent (e.g. `my-agent/`)
2. Add `agent-config.toml` with credentials, model config, and a schedule or webhook trigger
3. Add `PLAYBOOK.md` with the playbook — step-by-step instructions the LLM follows each run
4. If running in Docker mode and your agent needs tools beyond what the base image provides (git, curl, openssh-client, node), add a `Dockerfile` — see Docker Mode section below
5. Verify with `npx al status`
6. Run with `npx al start`

## Credential Reference

Credentials are managed by the user via `al doctor` and stored in `~/.action-llama-credentials/<type>/<instance>/<field>`. Reference them in `credentials` arrays as `"type:instance"` (e.g. `"github_token:default"`). The `:default` instance suffix can be omitted.

| Type | What it is | Fields | Runtime injection | What it enables |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| `anthropic_key` | Anthropic API key or OAuth token | `token` | Read directly by the agent SDK (not an env var) | LLM access — required for all agents |
| `github_token` | GitHub PAT (repo + workflow scopes) | `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` env vars | `gh` CLI, `git` over HTTPS, GitHub API |
| `git_ssh` | SSH private key + git identity | `id_rsa`, `username`, `email` | SSH key mounted as file; `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` configured automatically; `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`/`GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`/`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` set from `username`/`email` | `git clone`/`push` over SSH — **required for pushing to repos** |
| `sentry_token` | Sentry auth token | `token` | `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` env var | Sentry API via `curl` |
| `github_webhook_secret` | Shared HMAC secret | `secret` | Used by gateway only (not injected into agents) | Validates GitHub webhook payloads |
| `sentry_client_secret` | Sentry client secret | `secret` | Used by gateway only (not injected into agents) | Validates Sentry webhook payloads |

**IMPORTANT:** Agents MUST NEVER ask users for credentials directly (API keys, tokens, passwords, etc.). Agents MUST NEVER run `al doctor` or interact with the credential system on behalf of the user. If a credential is missing at runtime, the agent should report the error and stop — the user will run `al doctor` and `al start` themselves.

## Runtime Context

Every agent prompt has these XML blocks injected automatically at runtime:

### `<agent-config>`

JSON object containing the agent's custom `[params]` from `agent-config.toml`. Example:

```json
{"repos":["acme/app"],"triggerLabel":"agent","assignee":"bot-user"}
```

(In this example, `repos` is a custom param defined in `[params]` — not a built-in field.)

### `<credential-context>`

Lists which env vars and tools are available based on the agent's `credentials` array. Includes anti-exfiltration policy. The agent can rely on env vars like `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` being already set — it does NOT need to set them.

### `<webhook-trigger>` (webhook runs only)

JSON object with the webhook event details. Only present when the agent is triggered by a webhook (not on scheduled runs). Schema:

```json
{
  "source": "github",
  "event": "issues",
  "action": "labeled",
  "repo": "acme/app",
  "number": 42,
  "title": "Add dark mode",
  "body": "Issue description...",
  "url": "https://github.com/acme/app/issues/42",
  "author": "user",
  "assignee": "bot-user",
  "labels": ["agent"],
  "branch": null,
  "comment": null,
  "sender": "user",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### `<agent-trigger>` (agent-triggered runs only)

JSON object with the source agent name and context. Only present when the agent was triggered by another agent via a `[TRIGGER]` signal. Schema:

```json
{
  "source": "dev",
  "context": "I just opened PR #42 on acme/app. Please review it."
}
```

### Triggering other agents

An agent can trigger another agent by including a `[TRIGGER]` block in its output:

```
[TRIGGER: reviewer]
I just opened PR #42. Please review it.
URL: https://github.com/acme/app/pull/42
[/TRIGGER]
```

The scheduler will run the target agent with the context injected as an `<agent-trigger>` block. Rules:
- An agent cannot trigger itself
- If the target is busy or does not exist, the trigger is skipped
- Trigger chains are limited by `maxTriggerDepth` in `config.toml` (default: 3)

## Webhook Reference

### How webhooks work

1. The gateway receives an HTTP POST from GitHub or Sentry at `/webhooks/github` or `/webhooks/sentry`
2. The payload is validated using secrets loaded from the named credential instance (e.g. HMAC-SHA256 for GitHub using `github_webhook_secret`, client secret for Sentry using `sentry_client_secret`)
3. The gateway matches the event against all agents' `[[webhooks]]` entries (AND logic — all specified fields must match; omitted fields are not checked)
4. Matching agents are triggered with a `<webhook-trigger>` block injected into their prompt

### GitHub webhook fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Provider type — must be `"github"` (required) |
| `source` | string | Credential instance name (optional, e.g. `"MyOrg"`) |
| `repos` | string[] | Filter to specific repos (owner/repo format) |
| `events` | string[] | Event types: `issues`, `pull_request`, `push`, `issue_comment`, etc. |
| `actions` | string[] | Event actions: `opened`, `labeled`, `closed`, `synchronize`, etc. |
| `labels` | string[] | Only trigger when the issue/PR has ALL of these labels |
| `assignee` | string | Only trigger when assigned to this user |
| `author` | string | Only trigger for events by this author |
| `branches` | string[] | Only trigger for pushes/PRs on these branches |

### Sentry webhook fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Provider type — must be `"sentry"` (required) |
| `source` | string | Credential instance name (optional) |
| `resources` | string[] | Resource types: `error`, `event_alert`, `metric_alert`, `issue`, `comment` |

### GitHub webhook setup

In your GitHub repo settings, add a webhook:
- **Payload URL:** `http://<your-host>:8080/webhooks/github`
- **Content type:** `application/json`
- **Secret:** the same secret stored as the `github_webhook_secret` credential

### TOML syntax for webhooks

Each webhook is a separate `[[webhooks]]` block (double brackets = array of tables):

```toml
# Each [[webhooks]] is a separate array entry
[[webhooks]]
type = "github"
repos = ["acme/app"]
events = ["issues"]
actions = ["labeled"]
labels = ["agent"]

[[webhooks]]
type = "github"
source = "MyOrg"          # optional — credential instance name
repos = ["my-org/other-repo"]
events = ["pull_request"]

[[webhooks]]
type = "sentry"
resources = ["error", "event_alert"]
```

`type` is the provider type (required). `source` is the credential instance name (optional — defaults to `"default"`).

## `agent-config.toml` Complete Reference

The config file uses TOML syntax. The agent name is derived from the directory name — do not include it in the config.

### Minimal example (schedule only)

```toml
credentials = ["github_token:default", "git_ssh:default"]
schedule = "*/5 * * * *"

[params]
repos = ["your-org/your-repo"]
```

The `[model]` section is **optional** — agents inherit the default model from the project's `config.toml`. Only add `[model]` to an agent config if you want to override the default (e.g. use a different model or thinking level for that specific agent).

### Full example (schedule + webhooks + params + model override)

```toml
credentials = ["github_token:default", "git_ssh:default", "sentry_token:default"]
schedule = "*/5 * * * *"

# Optional: override the project default model for this agent
[model]
provider = "anthropic"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
thinkingLevel = "medium"
authType = "api_key"

[[webhooks]]
type = "github"
repos = ["acme/app"]
events = ["issues"]
actions = ["labeled"]
labels = ["agent"]

[[webhooks]]
type = "sentry"
resources = ["error", "event_alert"]

[params]
repos = ["acme/app", "acme/api"]
triggerLabel = "agent"
assignee = "bot-user"
sentryOrg = "acme"
sentryProjects = ["web-app", "api"]
```

### Field reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `credentials` | string[] | Yes | Credential refs as `"type:instance"` (see Credential Reference above) |
| `schedule` | string | No* | Cron expression (e.g. "*/5 * * * *") |
| `model` | table | No | LLM model config — omit to inherit from project `config.toml` |
| `model.provider` | string | Yes* | "anthropic" or "openai" |
| `model.model` | string | Yes* | Model ID (e.g. "claude-sonnet-4-20250514") |
| `model.thinkingLevel` | string | Yes* | off \| minimal \| low \| medium \| high \| xhigh |
| `model.authType` | string | Yes* | api_key \| oauth_token \| pi_auth |
| `webhooks[].type` | string | Yes | Provider type: "github" or "sentry" |
| `webhooks[].source` | string | No | Credential instance name (defaults to "default") |
| `webhooks[].repos` | string[] | No | Filter to specific repos |
| `webhooks[].events` | string[] | No | GitHub event types: issues, pull_request, push |
| `webhooks[].actions` | string[] | No | GitHub actions: opened, labeled, closed |
| `webhooks[].labels` | string[] | No | Only trigger for issues/PRs with these labels |
| `webhooks[].resources` | string[] | No | Sentry resources: error, event_alert, metric_alert, issue, comment |
| `params.*` | any | No | Custom key-value pairs injected into the prompt |

*At least one of `schedule` or `webhooks` is required. *Required within `[model]` if the agent defines its own model block.

### TOML syntax reminders

- Strings: `key = "value"`
- Arrays: `key = ["a", "b"]`
- Tables (objects): `[tableName]` on its own line, followed by key-value pairs
- Array of tables: `[[arrayName]]` on its own line — each block is one entry in the array
- Comments: `# comment`

## Example Playbook

**Agent playbooks must be detailed and prescriptive with step-by-step commands. Copy this example and customize rather than writing from scratch.**

The following is a complete, working PLAYBOOK.md for a developer agent. Use it as a template for all new agents:

```markdown
# Developer Agent

You are a developer agent. Your job is to pick up GitHub issues and implement the requested changes.

Your configuration is in the \`<agent-config>\` block at the start of your prompt.
Use those values for repos, triggerLabel, and assignee.

\`GITHUB_TOKEN\` is already set in your environment. Use \`gh\` CLI and \`git\` directly.
(Note: \`gh\` is not in the base Docker image — this agent needs a custom Dockerfile that installs it. See Docker Mode section.)

**You MUST complete ALL steps below.** Do not stop after reading the issue — you must implement, commit, push, and open a PR.

## Setup — ensure labels exist

Before looking for work, ensure the required labels exist on each repo. Run the following for each repo (these are idempotent — they succeed silently if the label already exists):

\`\`\`
gh label create "<triggerLabel>" --repo <repo> --color 0E8A16 --description "Trigger label for dev agent" --force
gh label create "in-progress" --repo <repo> --color FBCA04 --description "Agent is working on this" --force
gh label create "agent-completed" --repo <repo> --color 1D76DB --description "Agent has opened a PR" --force
\`\`\`

## Finding work

**Webhook trigger:** When you receive a \`<webhook-trigger>\` block, the issue details are already in the trigger context. Check the issue's labels and assignee against your \`triggerLabel\` and \`assignee\` params. If the issue matches (has your trigger label and is assigned to your assignee), proceed with implementation. If it does not match, respond \`[SILENT]\` and stop.

**Scheduled trigger:** Run \`gh issue list --repo <repo> --label <triggerLabel> --assignee <assignee> --state open --json number,title,body,comments,labels --limit 1\`. If empty, respond \`[SILENT]\` and stop.

## Workflow

1. **Claim the issue** — run \`gh issue edit <number> --repo <repo> --add-label in-progress\` to mark it as claimed.

2. **Clone and branch** — run \`git clone git@github.com:<repo>.git /workspace/repo && cd /workspace/repo && git checkout -b agent/<number>\`.

3. **Understand the issue** — read the title, body, and comments. Note file paths, acceptance criteria, and linked issues.

4. **Read project conventions** — in the repo, read \`PLAYBOOK.md\`, \`CLAUDE.md\`, \`CONTRIBUTING.md\`, and \`README.md\` if they exist. Follow any conventions found there.

5. **Implement changes** — work in the repo. Make the minimum necessary changes, follow existing patterns, and write or update tests if the project has a test suite.

6. **Validate** — run the project's test suite and linters (e.g., \`npm test\`). Fix failures before proceeding.

7. **Commit** — \`git add -A && git commit -m "fix: <description> (closes #<number>)"\`

8. **Push** — \`git push -u origin agent/<number>\`

9. **Create a PR** — run \`gh pr create --repo <repo> --head agent/<number> --base main --title "<title>" --body "Closes #<number>\\n\\n<description>"\`.

10. **Comment on the issue** — run \`gh issue comment <number> --repo <repo> --body "PR created: <pr_url>"\`.

11. **Mark done** — run \`gh issue edit <number> --repo <repo> --remove-label in-progress --add-label agent-completed\`.

## Rules

- Work on exactly ONE issue per run
- Never modify files outside the repo directory
- **You MUST complete steps 7-11.** Do not stop early.
- If tests fail after 2 attempts, create the PR anyway with a note about failing tests
- If the issue is unclear, comment asking for clarification and stop
```

## Docker Mode

Docker container isolation is enabled by default. Each agent run launches an isolated container with a read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, non-root user, and resource limits. Use `--no-docker` to disable it for development.

### Base image

The base image (`al-agent:latest`) is built automatically on first run. It includes Node.js, git, curl, openssh-client, and ca-certificates — the minimum needed for any agent.

### Custom agent images

If your agent needs extra tools (e.g. `gh` CLI, Python, `jq`), add a `Dockerfile` to the agent directory that extends the base image:

```dockerfile
FROM al-agent:latest
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gh && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
USER node
```

Agent images are built automatically on startup. If no `Dockerfile` is present, the agent uses the base image.

### Container filesystem

| Path | Mode | Contents |
|------|------|----------|
| `/app` | read-only | Action Llama application + node_modules |
| `/credentials` | read-only | Mounted credential files (`/<type>/<instance>/<field>`) |
| `/workspace` | read-write (tmpfs, 2GB) | Working directory — repos are cloned here |
| `/tmp` | read-write (tmpfs, 512MB) | Temporary files |
| `/home/node` | read-write (tmpfs, 64MB) | User home — `.ssh/` for SSH keys |

### Docker config options

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `local.enabled` | `true` | Enable Docker container isolation |
| `local.image` | `"al-agent:latest"` | Base Docker image name |
| `local.memory` | `"4g"` | Memory limit per container |
| `local.cpus` | `2` | CPU limit per container |
| `local.timeout` | `3600` | Max container runtime in seconds |

## Running Agents

Start all agents with `al start` (or `npx al start`). This starts the scheduler which runs all discovered agents on their configured schedules/webhooks. There is no per-agent start command — `al start` always starts the entire project.

### Automatic re-runs

When a scheduled agent completes productive work (i.e. it does not respond with `[SILENT]`), the scheduler immediately re-runs it. This continues until the agent reports `[SILENT]` (no more work), hits an error, or reaches the `maxReruns` limit. This way an agent drains its work queue without waiting for the next cron tick.

Set `maxReruns` in `config.toml` to control the limit (default: 10):

```toml
maxReruns = 5
maxTriggerDepth = 3   # max depth for agent-to-agent trigger chains (default: 3)
```

Webhook-triggered and agent-triggered runs do not re-run — they respond to a single event.
